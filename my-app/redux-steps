step 1 : install react-redux and @reduxjs/toolkit

react-redux gives us access to hooks such as useSeletor and useDispatch
whereas redux toolkit helps in state management through redux

step 2 : create store.js file 

step 3 : configure the store.js file using the configureStore hook from @reduxjs/toolkit

step 4 : import reducers and combine them with configureStore as  configureStire ({
    reducer : {
        counter : counterReducer,
        theme : themeReducer
    }
})

step 5 : create a slice.js file for each feature like counterSlice.js for counter and themeSlice.js for theme 

step 6 : create a slice instance and give it the required things like name of slice , initialState and reducers {
    action : () => {}
}

step 7 : export actions as const {action} = counterSlice.actions;

step 8 : ecport reducers as export default counterSlice.reducers

Note :whenever you ecport something as default you can rename it while importing 

like export default counterSlice.reducers can be imported in store.js as counterReducer from './counterSlice.js'


step 9 : wrap App component with <Provider> component from react-redux and provide store as a value in it now these slices will be acccessible to each and every component

step 10 : now you can use redux counter anywhere using useSlector and useDispatch hooks
